# Enginerino

## Overview
My first engine I created in 2016 in under one month. This project was the worst of it all mainly because I was building the engine from scratch with no knowledge of engine programming let alone C++ programming period. What better way than throwing your self into the fire

## Goals
My main goals for this project were:
- Getting the engine to work in general
- Implementing a game, more specifically Tetris created inside the engine
- Create a tutorial system that would talk to you and guide you on how to use the engine
- Instance Rendering because using so many box primitives, it only made sense to implement to optimize

## My Personal Engines:
### [**DayDreamEngine**](https://github.com/mray2014/DayDreamEngine)
- My latest engine I created to learn and study how to make an engine multi-threaded
- Combining all my years of experience with building engines to structure the engines architecure correctly
- Making the engine multiple platform so that adding new platforms like (DirectX/OpenGL/Vulkan) to the lower levels run smoothly

### [**Cosmic Engine**](https://github.com/mray2014/CosmicEngine)
- My third custom game engine I made that I believe is the best structured engine I've created so far
- Whats interesting about this project is that around this time I started learning about hardware and optimizations
- This engine put to test some architectures I thought of so structure the engine where most of the data was cache friendly optimized efficiently


### [**GenesisX**](https://github.com/mray2014/GenesisX)
- My second game engine I have created and it is honestly the one engine I most proud of
- After researching for weeks I finally implemented Deferred rendering into the engine, the hard work paid off
- Once I got that feature in I started steam rolling new graphical features in easily like HDR and Bloom because of all the knowledge I gained from Deferred Rendering
